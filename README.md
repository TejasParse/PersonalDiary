This is a Personal Diary Website. 
As of now it uses local MongoDB to store the entries

To run this first install all the dependencies by
npm install

Then make sure MongoDB server is running locally
To run it type "mongod" in cmd and keep it aside

Then using node/nodemon run the server
nodemon app.js

The website will then be accessible at
http://localhost:3000/

Thank you for using it!
